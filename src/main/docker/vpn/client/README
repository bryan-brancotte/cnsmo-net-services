Main Repository to track the VPN Integration with dockers

To install Docker:
Follow the official guide here https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/:
A script is provided to install docker in any gnu-linux supported by docker:
 - (in gnu-linux distro supported) sudo sh install_docker.sh

Modify "remote" property in client.conf file with the VPN server ip address.

To build the client:
 - docker build -t vpn-client .

To run the Docker:
 - docker run -t --net=host  --privileged -v /dev/net/:/dev/net/ vpn-client

A vagrant file is provided. It allows easily deploying the docker in a controlled environment (Ubuntu 14.04 VM).
Deployed VM will have the content of this repository in /vpn-client-service-config/ directory.

The following commands may be used to launch the docker container in the controlled environment using vagrant:

vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vpn-client-service-config/
sudo su
./install_docker.sh
docker build -t vpn-client .
docker run -t --net=host  --privileged -v /dev/net/:/dev/net/ vpn-client

Once you are finished:
^C
exit
exit
vagrant destroy
